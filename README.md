# Biomod

MOD IS UNDERGOING REWRITE FOR 1.14!

This is intended to become a Bionicle-inspired (Mata Nui/2001 only for the time being) mod to be used alongside NuiCraft by Eastonium. The player characters are more intended to have the Matoran/Tohunga role than that of a Toa.

**Features in the works:**  
*Elemental system:*
Pick 1 of 6 elements when your character joins a world the first time, granting some special effects, these being: Fire, Air, Earth, Ice, Water, Stone

*Bionicle tools:*
The 6* original Toas' and Turagas' weapons and staffs with unique effects - some more powerful than the others, but that's the way it is.
*no Pohatu shoes yet
